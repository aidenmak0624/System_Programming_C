//=====================================================================
Analysis:
How does the value of S affect turnaround time and response time? 
Is the difference in turnaround time and response time what you expected to see as S and the number of CPUs change? Why or why not?

Response:
As S increases, both turnaround time and response time generally increase across different types of tasks.
For example: 
Average Turnaround time per type:
1 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 3: 676725 usec
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 3: 638822 usec
Average Response time per type:
1 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 3: 4654 usec
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 3: 4545 usec

This increase in turnaround time is expected because longer time allotment means that lower priority tasks may wait longer before being scheduled/ priority boost, leading to a longer overall time to completion.

However there is insignificant to show response time is hugely affect as the task first enter in MLFQ will be assigned in first priority. 

Generally, Type 0 tasks tend to have the lowest turnaround and response times, while Type 2(long_task)/3(I/O) tasks have the highest.
Average Turnaround time per type:
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 0: 115939 usec
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 2: 607156 usec
8 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 0: 677372 usec
8 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 2: 588923 usec

Average Response time per type:
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 0: 4497 usec
1 CPU and reset priority after 200 us: Type 2: 4711 usec
8 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 0: 4623 usec
8 CPU and reset priority after 3200 us: Type 2: 4852 usec

This difference is expected as longer time types of tasks may have lower levels of priority or resource requirements most of the processing time, leading to differences in how quickly they are processed.
* There are observation that Type 0 increase significantly in 8 CPU, 3200 us compare to that of 1 CPU, 200us.
It is assumed that it is due to the priory boost (more tasks will be boost together at the same time if longer S) and resource management among CPU (lost of proccessor affinity?).

Analysis:
How does adjusting the S value in the system affect the turnaround time or response time for long-running and I/O tasks specifically? Does it appear to be highly correlated?

Response:
Adjusting the S value affects both long-running and I/O-bound tasks.

For long-running tasks, increasing S may lead to longer turnaround times as these tasks may need more CPU time to complete, and thus it would stay in lower priority queue for a long time until priority boost.

For I/O-bound tasks, same as long-running task! longer time slices may allow them to execute more CPU-bound operations before them being preempted (as lower priority more quickly compare to other same time task), potentially increasing their completion times.

There appears to be a positive correlation between S and both turnaround time and response time. As S increases, both time meausre tend to increase as well. This correlation is expected from behavior of the MLFQ algorithm, where longer time S lead to longer waiting times for tasks, incraasing both turnaround and response timesof most longer task.
